- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @M00CM4ST3R
- Iâ€™m interested in developing my coding skillset to pursue a career change away from digital marketing and into the tech industry
- Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Python and Django, to help with current responsibilities on websites, email newsletters, data visualisation and admin automation.
- Iâ€™m looking to build up a portfolio of projects and learn more about what direction I'd like to take my career.
- **Fun fact**: Once won an Art Attack competition as a kid (the prize was 2 Power Rangers videos!)
